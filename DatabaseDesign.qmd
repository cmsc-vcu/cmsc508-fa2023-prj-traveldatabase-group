# User Information

User ID -> User Name, Email, Password
Email -> User ID (assuming each email is unique)
Destination Information:

Destination ID -> Destination Name, Description, Travel Type
Destination Name -> Destination ID (assuming each destination has a unique name)
Hotel Information:

Hotel ID -> Hotel Name, Location, Price, Rating
Hotel Name -> Hotel ID (assuming each hotel has a unique name)
Tour Package Information:

Package ID -> Package Name, Description, Price
Package Name -> Package ID (assuming each package has a unique name)
User Choices:

User ID, Destination ID, Hotel ID, Package ID -> Check-in Date, Check-out Date, Total Price
User ID -> Destination ID, Hotel ID, Package ID (represents the choices made by the user)
These functional dependencies ensure the integrity and consistency of the database and provide information on how various data elements are related. For example:

User ID uniquely determines user-specific attributes such as the user's name and email.
Destination ID is a unique identifier for destinations, and Destination Name is also unique, so you can determine the name of a destination based on its ID.
Hotel ID uniquely identifies hotels, and Hotel Name is unique, so you can look up hotel details based on either the ID or the name.
Package ID is unique, and Package Name is unique, allowing you to identify package details using either.
User choices, which include user ID, destination ID, hotel ID, and package ID, determine related information such as check-in and check-out dates and total price.
These functional dependencies play a crucial role in maintaining data consistency, preventing redundancy, and helping the database management system enforce referential integrity constraints. Additionally, these dependencies facilitate efficient querying and retrieval of information for travelers looking to make decisions about their destinations, hotels, and tour packages.
