# Welcome to Semecter Project repository

Use this project scaffold for all your deliverables for the semester long project including deliverables 4 through 7.
Prior deliverables (1-3) did not require written documentation, and thus no repo.

DO NOT USE THE *./docs* FOLDER unless you're comfy with what you're doing!  This folder name is reserved for use by Quarto. Quarto will create and manage a public, static website in this folder once we set it up in a later assignment. You should
not store source files in the *./docs* folder unless you explicitly want them shared publically.

I created a few folders that you can use or not:

- *./src* - to hold your python/flask source code
- *./reports* - to hold your deliverable reports. Within this folder I recommend a consistent naming convention for file like *deliver4.qmd*, *deliver5.qmd*, etc.

YOU own this project so you can set up the folder structure as you will. I provided a simple structure to help you get started only.

PLEASE MODIFY THIS README FILE per instructions in [project deliverable 4](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/85746/assignments/725440?module_item_id=3019749).
You'll need to be adding links to your previous *pitch* video for deliverable 3.  You'll also want to include team member info in the readme.

This is a scaffold project. Iâ€™ll be providing scaffolds throughout the
semester to get you working faster, and to make grading much easier for
the TA team.

Good luck!
