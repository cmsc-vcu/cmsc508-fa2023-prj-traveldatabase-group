# Welcome to Travel Database Project 

## Project Description
This database gives an overview of what is expected from the travel database. We created designs and questions to further help explain what will be happening in this database. It is a good guide for moving forward while creating it.

The Travel Database is a dynamic platform tailored for travel enthusiasts, providing a centralized hub for crucial information on destinations, hotels, and tour packages. With a focus on enhancing the tourist experience, the database covers key domains such as Billing and Payments, Package Tours, Reviews and Ratings, and Accommodation Management. Our mission is to empower users to plan cost-effective and memorable journeys, offering a user-friendly interface that caters to the needs of friends and family who share a love for exploration.
